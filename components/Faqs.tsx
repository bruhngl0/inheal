          The sessions with Roshni helped my son express his thoughts during
          a difficult period for our family. We had explored various things, but
          it was through the creative aspect of art therapy that our son found
          his voice and released his bottled-up feelings. It not only helped
          him, but it also allowed us as parents to gain a better understanding
          of our child.
